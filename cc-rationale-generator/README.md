## File Structure

The tool is a single HTML file:

* `index.html`: This file contains all the necessary HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including light and dark mode themes), and JavaScript for the application's logic (multi-step form, data collection, validation, reference management, theme toggling, JSON and Markdown generation).

## Customization & Contribution

### Adding to the Reference Library or Author List

The reference library (`referenceLibrary` constant) and the list of authors for the checkboxes (`authorList` constant) are defined as arrays within the `<script>` section of `index.html`.

**To add new common references:**
1.  Open `index.html` and find the `<script>` tag.
2.  Locate the `referenceLibrary` array.
3.  Add a new object to the array with `label` (display name) and `uri` (the link) properties.
    ```javascript
    // Example:
    { label: "New Important Document", uri: "[https://example.com/new-doc](https://example.com/new-doc)" },
    ```
4.  If the reference is the Cardano Constitution (or a version of it that should trigger the article selector), also add `isConstitution: true`.

**To modify the author list:**
1.  Open `index.html` and find the `<script>` tag.
2.  Locate the `authorList` array.
3.  Add or remove author names (strings) as needed.
    ```javascript
    // Example:
    const authorList = [
        "Arne Rasmussen", "Bjarne", /* ... other current authors ... */ "New Author Name"
    ];
    ```
