# Conflict of Interest (COI) Registry Tool - Version 0.1

This tool is a simple, client-side HTML application designed to help manage a Conflict of Interest Registry for Tingvard, a member of the Cardano Constitutional Committee. It allows for adding, viewing, and editing entries, which are stored in a `Registry.json` file hosted on GitHub.


## Features

* **View Registry:** Displays all current conflict of interest entries.
* **Add New Entries:** Allows adding new COI declarations through a user-friendly form.
* **Edit Existing Entries:** Modify details of previously recorded conflicts.
* **Load from GitHub:** Automatically fetches the latest `Registry.json` from a predefined GitHub URL upon loading and via a "Reload" button.
* **Download JSON:** Allows downloading the current state of the registry (including any new additions or edits) as an updated JSON file.
* **Copy JSON:** Allows copying the current registry data to the clipboard.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts for easy viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.
* **No Hosting Required (if run locally):** Can run entirely in your web browser as a local HTML file, or can be accessed via its hosted URL.
* **Human-Readable JSON Output:** The generated JSON is pretty-printed and keys within each entry are consistently ordered for better readability on GitHub.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Tool:**
    * Access the tool directly in your web browser by navigating to:
      [https://tingvard-cc.github.io/tools/coi-registration/coi-registation.html](https://tingvard-cc.github.io/tools/coi-registration/coi-registation.html)
    * Alternatively, if you have a local copy, you can open the HTML file (e.g., `coi_registry_tool_v1.html`) in any modern web browser.

2.  **Loading Data:**
    * **Automatic Load:** When the tool opens, it will automatically attempt to fetch and display the `Registry.json` file from its configured GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thomas-nada/Test/main/Registry.json`.
    * **Reload from GitHub:** Click the "Reload from GitHub" button at any time to fetch the latest version from the repository.

3.  **Viewing Entries:**
    * Current entries will be displayed in a table (desktop) or as cards (mobile).

4.  **Adding a New Entry:**
    * Fill out the fields in the "Add New Conflict of Interest Entry" form.
    * Ensure you select a "Member" from the dropdown.
    * Click the "Add Entry" button.
    * The new entry will appear in the "Current Registry Entries" list.

5.  **Editing an Existing Entry:**
    * In the "Current Registry Entries" list, find the entry you wish to modify.
    * Click the "Edit" button for that entry.
    * The form fields will be populated with the entry's current data. The form title will change to "Edit Conflict of Interest Entry," and the "Add Entry" button will change to "Update Entry."
    * Make your desired changes in the form.
    * Click the "Update Entry" button to save the changes.
    * Click "Cancel Edit" to discard changes and revert the form.

6.  **Saving Changes to GitHub (Manual Process):**
    * This tool **does not** automatically save changes back to GitHub. You must do this manually.
    * **Option A: Download JSON:**
        1.  After making additions or edits, click the "Download Updated JSON" button. This will save a file (usually named `Registry_updated.json`) to your computer.
        2.  Go to your GitHub repository (`Thomas-nada/Test`).
        3.  Replace the existing `Registry.json` file with the `Registry_updated.json` file you just downloaded. You will likely need to:
            * Delete the old `Registry.json` or use the "Upload files" option and overwrite it.
            * Ensure the uploaded file is named exactly `Registry.json`.
        4.  Commit the changes to your repository.
    * **Option B: Copy JSON:**
        1.  After making additions or edits, click the "Copy JSON to Clipboard" button.
        2.  Go to your `Registry.json` file on GitHub.
        3.  Edit the file directly on GitHub.
        4.  Delete the old content and paste the copied JSON data.
        5.  Commit the changes.

## JSON Data Structure

The `Registry.json` file is an array of objects. Each object represents a single conflict of interest entry and should ideally contain the following keys in this order for readability:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique_identifier_string",
    "dateDeclared": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "member": "Member Name",
    "description": "Detailed description of the conflict.",
    "relatedEntity": "Name of the related entity or interest.",
    "mitigationMeasures": "Steps taken or proposed to mitigate the conflict.",
    "status": "Status of the conflict (e.g., Active, Resolved, Under Review, Recused)"
  }
  // ... more entries
]
id: A unique identifier automatically generated by the tool for new entries.dateDeclared: The date the conflict was declared, in YYYY-MM-DD format.member: The name of the Tingvard member associated with the conflict.description: A detailed text description of the conflict.relatedEntity: The name of the external party, project, or interest involved.mitigationMeasures: Text describing actions taken or planned to manage the conflict.status: The current status of the declared conflict.Technical NotesThis tool is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript.It relies on the browser's fetch API to load data from GitHub and the Clipboard API (with a fallback) for copying.No backend server is required for the tool to function if accessed via its hosted URL or run from the local file system.Future Considerations (Not Implemented in v1)Directly saving/committing changes to GitHub via its API (this would require handling authentication securely, likely via a backend service or more
